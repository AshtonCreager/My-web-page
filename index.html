					<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I was born and raised in northwest ohio. I grew up in napoleon ohio with my parents and 
		was the first born. I have two cats and two guniea pigs. I play a lot of video games, do karate,
		and used to play the saxophone. I used to be in the Napoleon band. I am currently on the Napoleon 
		esports team.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>My personal hobbies are obviously playing video games, I do karate as well, and I play the saxophone occasionally.
		I started playing video games at a young age, it all started with those lego games, and I've been hooked ever since.
		I started Karate at a young age as well, I've been involved for 10 years now. I dont play the saxphone as
		much as I used to due to me having to quit band but I try to play it here and there. Most of my hobbies 
		I do with my family. My whole family plays video games, we usually have a game night with just us. My mom,
		my brothers and I all do karate together as well.</p>
